In this study, a deep-learning-based writing glove is developed using ESP32 in which the inertial sensor serves as the only type of sensor. IMU data of 10 numerical characters are collected with a customized filtering 
algorithm to handle the fluctuation of IMU data. Two types of deep-learning models are implemented and tested including the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Convolution Neural Network (CNN). 
It has experimented with that CNN has a strong performance to classify time series IMU data with a testing accuracy of 92.2%, comparing to ANN with 76.0% accuracy. While the dataset is relatively small in this
study, this study has shown that the deep-learning approach for text input is reliable in the future given the larger scale of the dataset and more advanced deep-learning algorithms.Even though the performance is not reaching a practical performance, this study could be regarded as a basis of inertial-based character recognition by other researchers.
